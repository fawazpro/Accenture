**Description**

--> The problem solved is a Regression problem: estimated prediction is made using Neural network.
--> The network is trained on the client side where an ajax request with id=1 is sent to the server to archieve all
records currently in the 'farm' database. 
--> Every ajax request has its attached id-check code for more info.
--> To bind your own front end, as the one used is just a demo:
	1) You have to make an ajax request to get records of crops that are yet to be harvested instead of the one i made to get the entire record e.g
		write a query with condition as in: where qty_harvested = 0 and qty_of_on_harvest_waste = 0 and qty_of_post_harvest_waste =0
		-->This is because you only want to predict for crops that are yet to be harvested.
		-->Then output the prediction for each record from received along with the crop type and date if you want... Just modify the code as you wish
	2) You also want to show the crop type when the prediction is made: That can be easily done by using crop_id


**DB and Front end Setup***

--> Just create a database called 'farm' and import the farm_info.sql to initialize the table.
	Note that the Neural Network algorithm is dependent on the table columns and order.However, you can add additional columns
--> copy the 'farm' folder to your www directory
 


**Note**
--> The data used to train the network is just a dummy data.
